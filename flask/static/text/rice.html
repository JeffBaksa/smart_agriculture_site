<h4> Description </h4>
<p>
Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly Oryza glaberrima (African rice). The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.

As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population,[Liu 1] especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5 million metric tons or 817.4 million short tons in 2014), after sugarcane (1.9 billion metric tons or 2.1 billion short tons) and maize (1.0 billion metric tons or 1.1 billion short tons). Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.

<h4> Cultivation </h4>
<p>
While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.

<h4> Soil Requirements </h4>
<p>
Rice soil specially wetland rice soil is different from other upland crop soil. There are many chemical, physical and biological changes occur in rice soil. On the other hand rice plant is a semi-aquatic plant. In this regard characteristics of rice soil must be unique compared to other soil. Although pH of rice soil become neutral, it should be 5 - 8.

<h4> Climate Requirements </h4>
<p>
Rice originates in tropical lowlands and requires a long, warm growing season but is cultivated commercially in California and some of the Southeastern states. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 9b through 10a. It can be grown wherever nighttime temperatures stay above 60 degrees for at least three months of the year. Rice is traditionally grown in flooded fields, though this is not necessary for home production. However, it does require constant soil moisture to grow. Plant rice in poorly drained areas, if possible, and do not let the soil dry out.

<h4> Production </h4>
<p>
In 2017, world production of paddy rice was 769.7 million metric tons (848.4 million short tons)s, led by China and India with a combined 49% of this total. Other major producers were Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam. The five major producers accounted for 72% of total production, while the top fifteen producers accounted for 91% of total world production in 2017 (see table on right). Developing countries account for 95% of the total production.
