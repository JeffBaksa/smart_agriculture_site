<h4> Description </h4>
<p>
The chickpea or chick pea (Cicer arietinum) is an annual legume of the family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. Its different types are variously known as gram or Bengal gram, garbanzo or garbanzo bean, or Egyptian pea. Chickpea seeds are high in protein. It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes, and 9500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East. Chickpea is a key ingredient in hummus and chana masala, and it can be ground into a flour to make falafel. It is also used in salads, soups and stews, curry and other meal products like channa. The chickpea is important in Indian, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine.

<h4> Cultivation </h4>
<p>
The plant grows to 20–50 cm (8–20 in) high and has small, feathery leaves on either side of the stem. Chickpeas are a type of pulse, with one seedpod containing two or three peas. It has white flowers with blue, violet, or pink veins. They are grown mostly in India and other parts of the Indian subcontinent, as well as in Ethiopia, Mexico, and Iran. Desi means "country" or "native" in Hindi-Urdu; its other names include kala chana ("black chickpea" in Hindi-Urdu) or chholaa boot. Desi chana can be black, green or speckled. This variety is hulled and split to make chana dal.

<h4> Soil Requirements </h4>
<p>
Grow chickpeas in loose, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Add aged compost to planting beds in advance of planting. Avoid planting chickpeas where green manures have just grown or in soil high in nitrogen; this will result in green leafy growth, not seed production. Add potassium and phosphorus to the soil. Chickpea crops are best suited to well-drained loam and clay loam soils that are neutral to alkaline (pH 6.0–9.0) and have good water holding capacity.

<h4> Climate Requirements </h4>
<p>
Chickpea is a cool season annual crop performing optimally in 70° to 80°F daytime temperatures and 64° to 70°F night temperatures. They produce good yields in drier conditions because of their deep tap root.

<h4> Production </h4>

In 2019, India was responsible for 70% of global chickpea production.
