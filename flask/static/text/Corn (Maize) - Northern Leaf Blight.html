<h2> Crop: Corn (Maize) </h2>
<h2> Disease: Northern Leaf Blight </h2>
<br>

<h4> Cause(s) of Disease: </h4>
<p>
<br/> 1. Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is a foliar disease of corn (maize) caused by Exserohilum turcicum, the anamorph of the ascomycete Setosphaeria turcica. With its characteristic cigar-shaped lesions, this disease can cause significant yield loss in susceptible corn hybrids. 
<br/> 2. Infection occurs during periods of moderate (64° to 81°F), wet, and humid weather, such as cloudy days and heavy dew in fields along fence rows, tree lines and in bottomland. The fungus requires six to 18 hours of water on the leaf surface to cause infec- tion.

<br/><h4> How to Prevent & Cure the Disease: </h4><br/>
<p>
1. Choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight. 
<br/>2. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day. 
<br/>3. The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants. 
<br/>4. Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners this step isn’t needed, but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment. The infection usually begins around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied.
