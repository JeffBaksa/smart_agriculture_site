<h2> Crop: Apple Tree </h2>
<h2> Disease: Cedar Apple Rust </h2>
<br>

<h4> Cause(s) of Disease: </h4>
<p>
<br/>1. Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that depends on two species to spread and develop, usually within a mile of each other, a juniper species, usually eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and an apple, crabapple (Malus or Pyrus spp. depending on source), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) or quince (Cydonia oblonga). The fungus takes on different forms on each host and most readily noticeable on redcedar.
<br/>2. The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.

<br/><h4> How to Prevent & Cure the Disease: </h4><br/>
<p>
<br/>1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.
<br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.
<br/>3. The best way to do this is to prune the branches about 4-6 inches below the galls.
