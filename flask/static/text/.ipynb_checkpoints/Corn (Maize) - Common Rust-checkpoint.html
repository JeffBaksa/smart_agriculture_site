<h2> Crop: Corn (Maize) </h2>
<h2> Disease: Common Rust </h2>
<br>

<h4> Cause(s) of Disease: </h4>
<p>
<br/>1. Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of rust fungus. <br/>2. Common rust is commonly spread when conditions are moist with a high relative humidity of 95% or higher and mild temperatures of between 60 and 77 F. Spores land on foliage and within 3-6 hours of optimal conditions, germinate, and infect the plant.


<br/><h4> How to Prevent & Cure the Disease: </h4><br/>
<p>
1. Immediately spray with a fungicide!
<br/>2. Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most possess some degree of resistance.
<br/>3. However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control.
