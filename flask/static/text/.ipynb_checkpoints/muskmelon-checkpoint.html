<h4> Description </h4>
<p>
The flesh is either sweet or bland, with or without a musky aroma, and the rind can be smooth (such as honeydew), ribbed (such as cantaloupe), wrinkled (such as casaba melon), or netted (such as muskmelon). In North America, the sweet-flesh varieties are often collectively called muskmelon, including the musky netted-rind varieties and the inodorous smooth-rind varieties, and cantaloupe usually means the former type. However, muskmelon in a narrow sense only refers to the musky netted-rind type, while the true cantaloupe is the European type with ribbed and often warty rind that is seldom grown in North America.
The melon is an annual, trailing herb. Disease risk is reduced by crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops, avoiding crops susceptible to similar diseases as melons. Cross pollination has resulted in some varieties developing resistance to powdery mildew. Insects attracted to melons include the cucumber beetle, melon aphid, melonworm moth and the pickleworm.

<h4> Cultivation </h4>
<p>

</p>

<h4> Soil Requirements </h4>
<p>
Melons prefer warm, well-fertilized soil with good drainage that is rich in nutrients, but are vulnerable to downy mildew and anthracnose. They like loose, rich soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 that is well drained.

<h4> Climate Requirements </h4>
<p>
It grows well in subtropical or warm, temperate climates. Muskmelons grow best with average monthly temperatures of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and ripen best in dry weather.

<h4> Production </h4>
<p>
In 2016, global production of melons, including muskmelon, totaled 31.2 million tons, with China accounting for 51% of the world total (15.9 million tons). Other significant countries growing cantaloupe were Turkey, Iran, Egypt, and India producing 1 to 1.9 million tons, respectively.
