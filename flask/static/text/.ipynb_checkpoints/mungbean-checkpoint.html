<h4> Description </h4>
<p>
The mungbean is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods.

The English word mung originated (and used as is) from the Hindi word "moong", which is derived from the Sanskrit word "mudga".

<h4> Cultivation </h4>
<p>
The mung bean was domesticated in India, where its progenitor (Vigna radiata subspecies sublobata) occurs wild.

Carbonized mung beans have been discovered in many archeological sites in India. Areas with early finds include the eastern zone of the Harappan Civilisation in modern-day Pakistan and western- and northwestern India, where finds date back about 4,500 years, and South India in the modern state of Karnataka where finds date back more than 4,000 years. Some scholars, therefore, infer two separate domestications in the northwest and south of India. In South India, there is evidence for the evolution of larger-seeded mung beans 3,500 to 3,000 years ago. By about 3500 years ago mung beans were widely cultivated throughout India.

Cultivated mung beans later spread from India to China and Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical research at the site of Khao Sam Kaeo in southern Thailand indicates that mung beans had arrived in Thailand by at least 2,200 years ago.

<h4> Climate Requirements </h4>
<p>
Summer Moong is a short duration mung bean pulse crop grown in northern India. Due to its short duration, it can fit well inbetween of many cropping systems. It is mainly cultivated in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is considered to be the hardiest of all pulse crops and requires a hot climate for germination and growth.
