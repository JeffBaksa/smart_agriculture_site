<h4> Description </h4>
<p>
The pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), also known as arhar, tur, red gram, or gungo peas in Jamaica is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. Since its domestication in the Indian subcontinent at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale in South Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent. It is the primary accompaniment to rice or roti (flat bread) and has the status of staple food throughout the length and breadth of India.

<h4> Cultivation </h4>
<p>
Today, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the Old and the New Worlds. Pigeon pea is an important legume crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with cereals, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), or maize (Zea mays), or with other legumes, such as peanuts (Arachis hypogaea). Being a legume capable of symbiosis with Rhizobia, the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

<h4> Soil Requirements </h4>
<p>
It grows best at soil pH between 5.0 â€“ 7.0 and has adapted to soil pH as high as 8. It is reported to respond well to phosphorus fertilizer applications, moderately to potassium applications but nitrogen applications usually reduce yields. Plant seeds 1 inch deep, 1-2 feet apart in rows 2-4 feet apart.
</p>

<h4> Climate Requirements </h4>
<p>
Pigeon pea is common in the low dry and humid tropics but has been reported to be cultivated up to elevations of 6,000 ft in the Himalayas and to 9,000 ft in Venezuela. The optimum temperatures are between 64 and 100 degrees F.

<h4> Production </h4>
<p>
World production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons. About 63% of this production comes from India. Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.

The total number of hectares grown to pigeon pea is estimated at 5.4 million. India accounts for 72% of area grown to pigeon pea or 3.9 million hectares.
